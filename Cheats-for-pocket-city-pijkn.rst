Some cheats version don't work. Try to use action replay either V3 or V1. Your code header should look something like this: PAR_V1 infinite health (Add your code here) or. PAR_V3 infinite health (Add your code here) And do not add more than 9 codes to your files, gpsp will crash. Best way is to find some code breaker codes and covert them to Missing: pocket city. Tap “View”, then tap “Crime”, and then zoom out and try to find a small, dark area with high crime. After that, zoom in and check if there is a high number of criminals walking the streets. Then revert to normal “View” and tap the building at the center of the dark area.

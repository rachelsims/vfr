by Celebrity Interviews k Views. Albert Chang cheated on Lily Ki with another social media influencer, Sarah ‚Äúavocadopeeled‚Äù Lee. Lee had collaborated with both Chang and Ki in the past and was friends with both. Accordingly, Are Michael and Lily together? I know I'm gonna get some disagreement but I felt like it was always Lily who wanted to be with Albert and so I didn't feel like Albert cared that much back. Maybe it was just him being very quiet but I feel like he would have always returned the care that Lily gave if he truly liked her. It often looked like she was just a burden. There has been online speculation that Albert cheated on LilyPichu, but nothing has been confirmed by anyone close to them. She later made a blanket apology for the way that her OfflineTV friends got involved, and she also said that she'd likely be taking a break from her streaming and social media career.

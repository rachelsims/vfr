is this the real picture of jhansi ki rani lakshmibai kin files pil in bombay hc Tejasswi Prakash asks Karan Kundrra if he cheated on his ex-girlfriend after fight with ted Reading Time: 6 mins. She was cheated twice by the British. Firstly, in when they annexed Jhansi on the death of her husband, the Raja. Secondly, when they unjustly accused her of complicity in the mutiny and massacre that occurred in Jhansi 3 years later. It was Jiyaji Rao Sindhia who has not only cheated but betrayed Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi. Cheating is very low grade. We should say Jiyaji Rao was traitor who did not helped Rani Laxmi Bai when she ask for help from him for fighting against British in free struggle.

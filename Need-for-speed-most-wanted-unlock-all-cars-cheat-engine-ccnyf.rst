 · The biggest thing mising is the 'unlock all cars' features. There are 3. 1. - Add most cars to purchasable lists (aka Unlock cars). - Adds about 65 cars that were never meant for the player to 'obtain' - Adds all pinkslip cars as well. Address: - F00F *edit* The "unlock all cars" code moved to F19F in v (thanks cparty).  · As for a tutorial - Lets see how intuitive you can be. - Enable the 'Access all cars' cheat. - Open Disassembler. - In the top/code area, goto address EFEE (2 int 3's which is nothing code, then 15 lines of code, then more int 3's) - In the bottom/hex area, goto address 01C8D This is where the list of cars starts.

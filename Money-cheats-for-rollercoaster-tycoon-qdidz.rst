Added: Jul 20th In Forest Frontiers, when you first start don't win the objective. Instead, build a small park, make all the drinks/eats free, and advertise your park and a ride. To get more money, have a free entry price, and charge for large rollercoasters, and the lower the intensity of the rollercoaster, go down 50 cents in price. If you what a ride which is popular, makes money and will make guest ride over and over. Build the Steel Roller Coaster, Shuttle Loop in a big space.
